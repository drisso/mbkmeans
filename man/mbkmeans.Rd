\arguments{
\item{x}{The object on which to run mini-batch k-means. It can be a
matrix-like object (e.g., matrix, Matrix, DelayedMatrix, HDF5Matrix) with
genes in the rows and samples in the columns. Specialized methods are
defined for SummarizedExperiment and SingleCellExperiment.}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass to the matrix method.}

\item{whichAssay}{The assay to use as input to mini-batch k-means. If x is a
SingleCellExperiment, this is ignored unless \code{reduceMethod = NA}.}

\item{reduceMethod}{Name of dimensionality reduction results to use as input
to mini-batch k-means. Set to NA to use the full matrix.}

\item{clusters}{the number of clusters}

\item{batch_size}{the size of the mini batches. By default, it equals the
number of observations if there are less than 100 cells and 5 percent of
observations otherwise.}

\item{max_iters}{the maximum number of clustering iterations}

\item{num_init}{number of times the algorithm will be run with different
centroid seeds}

\item{init_fraction}{percentage of data to use for the initialization
centroids (applies if initializer is \emph{kmeans++} ). Should be a float
number between 0.0 and 1.0. By default, it uses all the data if there are
less than 100 cells and 25 percent of the data otherwise.}

\item{initializer}{the method of initialization. One of \emph{kmeans++} and
\emph{random}. See details for more information}

\item{calc_wcss}{either TRUE or FALSE, indicating whether the result of WCSS
is shown. FALSE is default}

\item{early_stop_iter}{continue that many iterations after calculation of the
best within-cluster-sum-of-squared-error}

\item{verbose}{either TRUE or FALSE, indicating whether progress is printed
during clustering}

\item{CENTROIDS}{a matrix of initial cluster centroids. The rows of the
CENTROIDS matrix should be equal to the number of clusters and the columns
should be equal to the columns of the data}

\item{tol}{a float number. If, in case of an iteration (iteration > 1 and
iteration < max_iters) 'tol' is greater than the squared norm of the
centroids, then kmeans has converged}

\description{
This is an implementation of the mini-batch k-means algorithm of
  Sculley (2010) for large single cell sequencing data with the
  dimensionality reduction results as input in the reducedDim() slot.
}
\details{
The implementation is largely based on the
  \code{\link[ClusterR]{MiniBatchKmeans}} function of the \code{ClusterR}
  package. The contribution of this package is to provide support for on-disk
  data representations such as HDF5, through the use of \code{DelayedMatrix}
  and \code{HDF5Matrix} objects, as well as for sparse data representation
  through the classes of the \code{Matrix} package. We also provide
  high-level methods for objects of class \code{SummarizedExperiment},
  \code{SingleCellExperiment}, and \code{LinearEmbeddingMatrix}.

This function performs k-means clustering using mini batches.
